1. what is MONGO-DB ?

=> MongoDB is a non-relational document database that provides support for 
   JSON-like storage

=> The MongoDB database has a flexible data model that enables you to store 
   unstructured data, and it provides full indexing support, and replication 
   with rich and intuitive APIs.

=> an open source NoSQL database management program

=> NoSQL is used as an alternative to traditional relational databases. NoSQL 
   databases are quite useful for working with large sets of distributed data. 
   MongoDB is a tool that can manage document-oriented information, store or 
   retrieve information.

=> MongoDB store data in form of documents.
=> MongoDB uses BSON(just like JSON) to query databases

2. difference between SQL and NoSQL ?

=> SQL database are in structure() while NoSQL have no structure 
=> SQL have pre-defined schema while NoSQL have dynamic schema (we need to create)
=> SQL better for multi-row trascations while NoSQL better for unstructured data
   like document or JSON.

3. difference between JSON an BSON ?

=> BSON is faster, can cosumed more space, lighweight.
otheside JSON used to tranmission data(API fetch) but,
BSON is used storage the data. 

=> Binary vs. text: BSON is a binary-encoded format, whereas JSON is a text-based format. 
This means that BSON is compact for transmitting over a network, while JSON is 
human-readable and easier to work with in various contexts.

what is express.json() and express.urlencoded({extended : false}) ?

When talking about express.json() and express.urlencoded() think specifically about POST 
requests (i.e. the .post request object) and PUT Requests (i.e. the .put request object)

# express.json()

express.json() it will parse the body from post/fetch request except from html
post form. It wont parse information from the html post form :

<form action="/" method="POST">
    <input type="text" name="username">
    <button>Submit</button>
</form>

but it will not gonna parse when we Submit this form

parse means => resolve (a sentence) into its component parts and describe their syntactic roles.

For instance, if you fill the form with "Manan" then submit it, Express wont have an idea 
what inside the body with this express code:

will send {} after you click submit. But if you uncommented 
app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: false})), then you will get {"username": "Manan"}.

So the difference is express.json() is a body parser for post request except html post form
and express.urlencoded({extended: false}) is a body parser for html post form.

HOW TO CONNNECT REST API TO SERVER?

Step #1 – Enter the URL of the API in the textbox of the tool. 
Step #2 – Select the HTTP method used for this API (GET, POST, PATCH, etc). 
Step #3 – Enter any headers if they are required in the Headers textbox. 
Step #4 – Pass the request body of the API in a key-value pair.
